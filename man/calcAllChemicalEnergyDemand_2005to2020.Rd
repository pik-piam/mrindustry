\title{Calculates chemical energy demand from 2005 to 2020 from chemical production per route (AllChemicalRoutes_2005to2020) 
and specific energy consumption for the different routes (retrieved from IEA_PetrochemEI and other literature sources).
The energy demand for OtherChem is calculated as the remaining share of total chemical industry energy demand. 
Results are aggregated to the country level.}
