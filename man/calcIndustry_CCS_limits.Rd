stages.  See Details.}

CCS projects to REMIND industry subsectors.  See Details.}

the regional resolution on which data should be extrapolated.  If \code{NULL}
(the default), extrapolation is done at the country level.}

\description{
Calculate Limits on Industry CCS Capacities
}
\details{
The limits on industry CCS capacities are calculated from data of the
Global Status of CCS 2023 report (through
mrremind::readGlobalCCSinstitute().  CCS projects are
\itemize{
\item filtered for valid (i.e. not "Under Evaluation") data for "Operation date"
and "CO~2~ capture capacity"
\item assigned to REMIND industry subsectors according to \code{facility_subsector},
which defaults to\tabular{ll}{
   Facility Industry \tab subsector \cr
   Cement \tab cement \cr
   Chemical \tab chemicals \cr
   Hydrogen / Ammonia / Fertiliser \tab chemicals \cr
   Ethan \tab chemicals \cr
   Iron and Steel Production \tab steel \cr
}

\item weighted by lifecycle stage according to \code{stage_weight}, which defaults to\tabular{lr}{
   Lifecycle stage \tab weight \cr
   Operational \tab 100 \% \cr
   In construction \tab 100 \% \cr
   Advanced development \tab 50 \% \cr
   Early development \tab 20 \% \cr
}

}

The resulting project capacities constitute the limits on industry subsector
CCS capacity for 2025.  The limit on CCS capacities for regions (or countries
if \code{region_mapping} is \code{NULL}) is set to a value of total 2025 subsector CCS
capacity, times the regions share in subsector activity (e.g. cement
production) of the SSP2 scenario
\itemize{
\item in 2030 if the region as some CCS capacity in 2025 in a different industry
subsector, or
\item in 2035 if the region has no industry CCS capacity in 2030 at all.
}

CCS capacities are increased by the annual growth factor \code{a1} for the ten
first years, and by the annual growth factor \code{a2} afterwards (defaulting to
70 \% and 20 \%, respectively).
